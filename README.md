This project is an intelligent microcontroller based wireless system.
The main objective is to convert a hand gesture to speech and text.
Basically gestures are the input to the system.
Flex sensors are used to convert these gestures into a microcontroller input.
The glove is fitted with flex sensors along the length of each finger and the thumb. The flex sensors give output in the form of voltage variation that varies with degree of bend. This flex sensor output is given to the ADC channels of microcontroller. It processes the signals and perform analog to digital signal conversion. Further the processed data is sent in a wireless manner to the receiver section. In this section the gesture is recognized and the corresponding output is displayed on LCD and simultaneously a speech output is play backed through speaker.
